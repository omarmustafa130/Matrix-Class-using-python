# Matrix-Class-using-python

A small project related to the Intro to self-driving cars nanodegree at Udacity.
Made to practice object oriented programming in python and math matrix skills.
I implemented the following functions: determinant, trace, inverse, and transpose. 
And implemented some overloaded operators such as: __add__, __sub__, __mult__, __neg__, and __rmul__

I have also used exception raises and docstring.
